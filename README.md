# ViT_Resnet_LSTM_GastricBiopsyCancerDetector
I developed ResNet CNN and Vision Transformer models trained on gastric data, and an LSTM model trained on movie reviews. I created a Flask-based website for deploying these models, allowing users to upload images for ResNet and ViT predictions. The LSTM generates automated responses based on user feedback.
